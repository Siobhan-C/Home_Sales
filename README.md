# Home_Sales / Module 22

Dear Reviewer / Grader:
Please see the following submission: https://github.com/Siobhan-C/Home_Sales/
- Specifically, see Home_Sales - backup - Final.ipynb. This was the most complete version I could generate.... 

Please note, there are errors within this code that I could not fix. 
I uninstalled and downloaded programs, restarted my computer multiple times, closed kernals, restarted kernals, dowloaded the materiak at least a half-dozen times, had multiple people attempt to help me, including a 2hour ticket at AskMCS, attempted to use Google Colab (didn't work) and other methods to trouble shoot (also to no avail) -- we could not figure out the issue.  I've attached screen shots as examples. It seemed as if the more I worked on it, the worst it became.

Noted there are missing or imperfect components, I am hoping you can evaluate the core work that was done. I understand this may affect the grade, but I'd be grateful if you wouldn't mark it as missing. I'm working diligently to complete all my assignments and will resubmit this one if possible. My priority is passing the course, and I appreciate your understanding and help.

Sincerely, 
Siobhan Curran


Instructions:

Rename the Home_Sales_starter_code.ipynb file as Home_Sales.ipynb.
Import the necessary PySpark SQL functions for this assignment.
Read the home_sales_revised.csv data in the starter code into a Spark DataFrame.
Create a temporary table called home_sales.

Answer the following questions using SparkSQL:
What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
What is the average price of a home for each year the home was built, that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.
What is the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.
Cache your temporary table home_sales.
Check if your temporary table is cached.
Using the cached data, run the last query that calculates the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.
Partition by the "date_built" field on the formatted parquet home sales data.

Create a temporary table for the parquet data.
Run the last query that calculates the average price of a home per "view" rating having an average home price greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.
Uncache the home_sales temporary table.
Verify that the home_sales temporary table is uncached using PySpark.
Download your Home_Sales.ipynb file and upload it into your "Home_Sales" GitHub repository.



Please note, to complete this assignment I used in class and external resources including, but not limited to ChatGPT, Bard/Google, websites (stackoverflow, Microsoft Learn, etc), ASU/Bootcamp tutors, ASKBCS, external tutors, and AI powered assistance.
